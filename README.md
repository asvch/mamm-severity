The .ipynb file is also viewable on 

Predict whether a mammogram mass is benign or malignant using four attributes (age, shape, margin, and density.) 

- Applied numerous supervised machine learning techniques and ensemble learning methods to determine the best
approach for predicting severity of mammogram masses based on age, shape, margin, and density data.
- Yielded the best results using Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and SVMâ€™s RBF kernel.
- Attained highest cross validation score of 80.72%.
